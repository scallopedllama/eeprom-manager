The following features would be nice to have in EEPROM Manager

* Add support for other JSON types: int, float, bool, null (?), object (probably not), array (probably not)
* Detect and remove misbehaving EEPROMs from pool
* Tests
* Non-Blocking Mode
* Mode of operation that prevents excessive reading and writing to EEPROM. Manager in separate process? EEPROM Contents backed on ramdisk?
